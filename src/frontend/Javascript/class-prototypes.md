### Classes and Prototypes | Section Overview

We just thoroughly explored classes and prototypes in JavaScript. Many of the concepts we discussed span even beyond the realm of ES6 and JS, so these lessons will translate to most programming languages you come across.

We covered a lot of ground though. It may feel nice to take an optional coding break. Grab some coffee, tea, or whatever you need - the usual!

Ok, let’s review the important topics we went over:

Classes in JavaScript construct structures of data based off of the state and behavior of real world objects and introduce a system of inheritance.

The constructor keyword initializes an object for a class.

The extends keyword creates subclasses and children of parent classes.

Static methods in classes can be called even outside the context of class.

Object-oriented programming models objects to create programs centered around the interactions of these objects with each other. Major programming languages like C, Java, and Ruby contain heavy support for object-oriented programming.

JavaScript is not based on object-oriented programming, but a prototypal-inheritance model.

A prototype is a characteristic in every JavaScript object that reveals its parent and the properties that it inherits.

All JavaScript objects contain a prototype and can trace their chain of prototypal inheritance all the way back to the base level Object prototype.

Arrow functions don’t create their own local ‘this’ object like a normal function prototype, but instead refer to the ‘this’ tied to its outer scope.

Classes and prototypes appear everywhere in JavaScript. And every ES6 programmer needs to grasp these fundamental concepts to truly grasp how the language works. Luckily, once you understand that classes are simply prototypes, and prototypes are simply references to an object’s parent, it becomes less abstract.

Ok class (or should I say prototype?), off to the next subject!
