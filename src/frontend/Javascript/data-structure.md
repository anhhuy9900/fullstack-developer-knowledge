## Data Structures in ES6 | Section Overview

At this point, you have possibly come familiar with these coding breaks and section overviews. If you usually get up to grab a snack or something to drink at this point, by all means do so! Otherwise, if you want to go through this course at a quicker pace and skip this review, do that as well. Remember that the pace of this course remains your decision.

Letâ€™s highlight the main topics that appeared in this section:

Data Structures in computer science refer to the programming storage of data for efficient usage in applications and algorithms.

A Set compares to a more advanced array that has all unique elements and no duplicate values.

Set iteration frequently occurs through the values() helper method.

A Map represents a more advanced object in es6 with key-value pairs that can have non-string keys.

Map iterate frequently occurs through the entries() helper method.

This wraps this section on the new clean and shiny data structures that es6 provided for us. This marks only the beginning of an extensive field of computer science that deals with data structures and algorithms. After all, these highly optimized seemingly theoretical concepts actually power large enterprise applications. Efficiency in time and resources has a monetary value. Therefore, companies and programmers alike highly appreciate the benefits of implementing data structures for their many benefits.
