### Index

MongoDB offers several index types optimized for various query lookups and data types:

* Single Field Indexes are used to a index single field in a document
* Compound Field Indexes are used to index multiple fields in a document
* Multikey Indexes are used to index the content stored in arrays
* Geospatial Indexes are used to efficiently index geospatial coordinate data
* Text Indexes are used to efficiently index string content in a collection
* Hashed Indexes are used to index the hash values of specific fields to support hash-based sharding
