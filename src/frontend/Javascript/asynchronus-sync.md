Asynchronous Programming, Promises, and APIs | Section Overview with Joke

You’ve made it to the end of a significant section on asynchronous programming, promises, and apis. Some deep computer science concepts showed up so let’s take a moment to review them.

But first, it’s always worth mentioning that the pace of this course remains up to you. Grab some tea or coffee at this time, if you like!

On that note, a few highlighted concepts from this section include:

Synchronous programming refers to programs that run sequentially, from top to bottom, that may or may not encounter blocking operations that affect the run time.

Asynchronous programming refers to programs that run on a looped operation and divert blocking operations to handlers in order maintain the run time.

User interfaces and browsers implements systems based on asynchronous programming in order to handle the unpredictability of user events such as clicks, mouse moves, and more.

ES6 promises allow programs to handle asynchronous processes by representing values that will return at some point in the future.

Promises can exist in one of the three following states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

HTTP or HyperText Transfer Protocol defines the foundation for data communication over the world wide web.

HTTP Request methods include:

GET for retrieving data from a server

POST for sending data to a server

HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, and more…

The Fetch method begins to provides access in ES6 to HTTP request methods and grab data from apis by returning a promise that stands in for resulting data.
